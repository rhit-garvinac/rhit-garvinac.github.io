						<h2><a href="#">Gomoku</a></h2>
						<img src="images/portfolio/item1.PNG">
						<p> In my spare time when I was learning Java, I created an implementation of Gomoku, or Five-in-a-Row. I
						used Java's built-in classes for drawing and animation to recreate this game. I think this game turned
						out pretty good and it taught me a lot about the inner workings of Java.</p>
					</li>

						<h2><a href="#">Binary Assembly Decoder</a></h2>
						<img src="images/portfolio/item2.PNG" id="datapath">
						<p> The Binary Assembly Decoder is a MIPS-like processor that I created for my Computer Architecture class last
						year. My largest contribution to the project was I was creating the assembler, which ran in Java and used a HashMap
						to run in O(n^2) time. Overall, I think this project was a success and it is objectively my coolest project to date.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2><a href="#">Map Making Software</a></h2>
						<img src="images/portfolio/item3.PNG">
						<p> I created the framework for a map-designing software. Users could place their own nodes and make connections
						between the points as they saw fit. I plan to redesign it to make it more functional on smaller devices like
						phones and tablets, and I plan to actually deploy it on the web.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2><a href="#">Portfolio Website</a></h2>
						<img src="images/portfolio/item4.PNG">
						<p> I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website you are reading right now!
						I designed the website to outline my qualifications in a cohesive and convenient way.
						Through this project I learned more about website design and deploying websites with Firebase.</p>
